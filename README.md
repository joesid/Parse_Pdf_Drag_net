# Parse_Pdf_Drag_net

The index1.py was designed to Parse the content of a Pdf document(a letter) then Take the first two strings after the first occurence of the word "Dear"

Then use this strings, to rename the file, by adding it to the front of the filename.

The index2.py, basically truncates every character after the string "Letter" in the filename but stops right before the extension ".pdf"
